Now for the punishments...

Moderation System:
We operate a 3 strike system, that means on your 3rd or above warning/strike, punishment will be given. 
1st and 2nd Strikes: These can be given by all moderators, staff, server supervising officers and  owners. If you break a rule and they deem it to be in violation, they will warn you using our bot. These warnings are then stored on a file in the bot on you. These offences lead to nothing.
3rd Strike: On your 3rd strike received by a moderator, you may be muted for up to a period of 1 day, this period is decided by a moderator and not a member of staff, or no action can be taken depending on the offence. This is also stored on the bot.
4th Strike: From this point onwards, you can be muted for up to 2 days, or no action can be taken if itâ€™s a minor offence.
5th Strike: You can now be kicked or muted for up to 3 days. Punishment on the 5th Strike and above is compulsory.
6th Strike: You can now be muted for a period of up a week and banned or kicked.
7th Strike: You can be muted for up to 2 weeks and could still be banned or kicked.
8th Strike: You can now be muted for a month or banned/kicked.
9th Strike: You can be muted indefinitely or be permanently banned.
10th Strike: Permanently banned.

If the offence is more serious however, punishment of a more severe level of strike can be given with approval from a SSO.

Please do not hesitate to contact a member of staff if a user breaks the rules or you have any questions or concerns regarding our rules.

By joining the server you automatically agree to the rules.
